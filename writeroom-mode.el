;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode implements a distraction-free writing mode similar to
;; the famous Writeroom editor for OS X.
;;
;; # Usage #
;;
;; Install this file in the usual way and activate it in a buffer by
;; calling `M-x writeroom-mode RET`. By default, `writeroom-mode` does the
;; following things:
;;
;; * activate fullscreen
;; * disable transparency
;; * disable the tool bar
;; * disable the scroll bar
;; * disable the fringes
;; * disable the mode line
;; * add window margins to the current buffer so that the text is 80
;;   characters wide.
;;
;; The last three effects are buffer-local. The other effects apply to the
;; current frame. Because `writeroom-mode` is a minor mode, this isn't
;; entirely on the up and up, since minor modes aren't supposed to have
;; such global effects. But `writeroom-mode` is meant for distraction-free
;; writing, so these effects do make sense. Besides, if you're in the mood
;; for writing without distractions, you're not going to switch from the
;; buffer holding your text anyway, are you now? ;-)
;;
;; All effects listed above can be switched off separately in the
;; customization group `writeroom`. Fullscreen, transparency, scroll-bar
;; and tool-bar can be switched off by removing the relevant functions from
;; `writeroom-global-functions`, the other effects have a corresponding
;; toggle. The width of the text area is controlled by the option
;; `writeroom-width`. It can be an absolute value, in which case it
;; indicates the number of columns, or it can be a relative value. In that
;; case, it should be a number between 0 and 1.
;;
;; The option `writeroom-global-functions` can be used to add additional
;; global effects. Just write a function for enabling and disabling the
;; relevant effect and add it to the list. See the doc string of this
;; option for some more details.
;;
;; It is possible to activate `writeroom-mode` in more than one buffer. The
;; global effects are of course activated only once and they remain active
;; until `writeroom-mode` is deactivated in *all* buffers.
;;
;; # Fullscreen limitations #
;;
;; Fullscreen as implemented here only works on Linux. It can be made to
;; work on OS X as well, if you compile Emacs with the patches from
;; <ftp://ftp.math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp/emacs/>. Alternatively, OS X has its own
;; way of making windows fullscreen: <http://support.apple.com/kb/PH4530>.
;;
;; More tips on getting a fullscreen Emacs can be found here:
;; <http://emacswiki.org/emacs/FullScreen>
