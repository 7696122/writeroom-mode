1 Writeroom-mode
****************

‘writeroom-mode’ is a minor mode for Emacs that implements a
distraction-free writing mode similar to the famous Writeroom editor for
OS X. ‘writeroom-mode’ is meant for GNU Emacs 24, lower versions are not
actively supported.

1.1 Upgrading from version 2
============================

The current version of ‘writeroom-mode’ is 3.0.  If you’re upgrading
from version 2.x and you have custom global effects, you will probably
have to redo them, because the arguments passed to the global effect
functions have been changed to make them compatible with those used to
(de)activate minor modes.  See the section *note Adding global effects:
#adding-global-effects. for details.

1.2 Installation
================

‘writeroom-mode’ can be installed through the package manager from Melpa
(http://melpa.org/).  If installing manually, make sure to also install
‘visual-fill-column’.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Usage,  Next: Customisation,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Writeroom-mode

1.3 Usage
=========

‘writeroom-mode’ can be activated in a buffer by calling ‘M-x
writeroom-mode RET’.  By default, ‘writeroom-mode’ does the following
things:

   • activate fullscreen
   • disable transparency
   • disable the menu bar
   • disable the tool bar
   • disable the scroll bar
   • maximise the current window (i.e., delete all other windows in the
     frame)
   • place the fringes outside the margins
   • disable the mode line
   • add window margins to the current buffer so that the text is 80
     characters wide

The last three effects are buffer-local.  The other effects apply to the
current frame.  Because ‘writeroom-mode’ is a minor mode, this isn’t
entirely on the up and up, since minor modes aren’t supposed to have
such global effects.  But ‘writeroom-mode’ is meant for distraction-free
writing, so these effects do make sense.

All these effects can be disabled or customised.  In addition, there are
several more options that are disabled by default but can be enabled in
the customisation buffer.

1.4.1 Global Writeroom Mode
---------------------------

Activate this option to automatically turn on ‘writeroom-mode’ in any
buffer that has one of the major modes in ‘writeroom-major-modes’.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Border Width,  Next: Fringes Outside Margins,  Prev: Global Writeroom Mode,  Up: Customisation

1.4.2 Border Width
------------------

Width of the border around the text area.  Disabled by default, see
‘writeroom-global-effects’ to enable the border.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Fringes Outside Margins,  Next: Extra Line Spacing,  Prev: Border Width,  Up: Customisation

1.4.3 Fringes Outside Margins
-----------------------------

If set, place the fringes outside the margins.  ‘writeroom-mode’ expands
the window margins, causing the fringes to be pushed inside, which may
be visually distracting.  This option keeps the fringes at the window’s
edges.  Unset it if you prefer to have the fringes close to the text.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Extra Line Spacing,  Next: Fullscreen Effect,  Prev: Fringes Outside Margins,  Up: Customisation

1.4.4 Extra Line Spacing
------------------------

Increase the line spacing.  Can be an absolute value (the number of
pixels to add to the line) or a number relative to the default line
height.  Disabled by default.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Fullscreen Effect,  Next: Global Effects,  Prev: Extra Line Spacing,  Up: Customisation

1.4.5 Fullscreen Effect
-----------------------

Effect to apply when ‘writeroom-mode’ activates fullscreen.  Can be
‘fullboth’, which uses the entire screen (i.e., window decorations are
disabled and the window manager’s panel or task bar is covered by the
Emacs frame) or ‘maximized’, in which case the Emacs frame is maximised
but keeps its window decorations and does not cover the panel.

1.4.6 Global Effects
--------------------

List of global effects:

   • fullscreen
   • transparency
   • scroll bar
   • menu bar
   • tool bar
   • border (add a border around the text area; disabled by default)
   • sticky (display the window on all virtual workspaces; disabled by
     default)

Each option can be enabled or disabled individually.

1.4.7 Major Modes
-----------------

List of major modes in which ‘writeroom-mode’ should be activated
automatically.  Use in conjunction with ‘global-writeroom-mode’.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Maximize Window,  Next: Restore Window Config,  Prev: Major Modes,  Up: Customisation

1.4.8 Maximize Window
---------------------

Maximise the current window in its frame, i.e., delete all other
windows.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Restore Window Config,  Next: Width,  Prev: Maximize Window,  Up: Customisation

1.4.9 Restore Window Config
---------------------------

Restore the window configuration that existed before ‘writeroom-mode’
was activated.  This is primarily useful if you use ‘writeroom-mode’ in
only a single buffer, since the window configuration that is restored is
the one that existed at the moment when ‘writeroom-mode’ is called for
the first time.  Disabled by default.


File: writeroom-mode.info,  Node: Width,  Prev: Restore Window Config,  Up: Customisation

1.4.10 Width
------------

Width of the text area.  Can be specified as an absolute value (number
of characters) or as a fraction of the total window width (in which case
it should be a number between 0 and 1).

1.5 The mode line
=================

By default, ‘writeroom-mode’ disables the mode line.  Because the mode
line can actually contain useful information, this may be impractical.
For this reason, it is possible to use a customised mode line, which
allows you to display information that is indispensable to you (e.g.,
the modified status, the file name).

If, for some reason, you need to look at the full mode line, you can use
the command ‘writeroom-toggle-mode-line’.  This command makes the mode
line visible in the header line (at the top of the window).  Calling it
again hides the mode line.  This command is bound to ‘s-?’ (‘s’ is the
super key, i.e., the Windows key on PCs, the ⌘ key on Macs), but it can
be rebound by putting something like the following in your ‘init.el’:

(with-eval-after-load 'writeroom-mode
  (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd "s-?") nil)
  (define-key writeroom-mode-map (kbd "<some-key>") #’writeroom-toggle-mode-line))

The first ‘define-key’ disables the binding for ‘s-?’.  Substitute your
preferred key binding in the second line to bind
‘writeroom-toggle-mode-line’ to it.

1.6 Multiple writeroom-mode buffers
===================================

It is possible to activate ‘writeroom-mode’ in more than one buffer.
The global effects are of course activated only once and they remain
active until ‘writeroom-mode’ is deactivated in _all_ buffers.
Alternatively, if you use ‘writeroom-mode’ in multiple buffers with
particular major modes (e.g., ‘text-mode’, ‘markdown-mode’), you can use
the global minor mode ‘global-writeroom-mode’.  This function enables
the global effects and activates the buffer-local effects in all
(current and future) buffers that have a major mode listed in the user
option ‘writeroom-major-modes’ (by default only ‘text-mode’).

When ‘global-writeroom-mode’ is active, the function ‘writeroom-mode’
can still be called to enable or disable ‘writeroom-mode’ in individual
buffers (regardless of their major mode, of course).  Calling
‘global-writeroom-mode’ again disables ‘writeroom-mode’ in all buffers
in which it is active, also those in which it was activated manually.

1.7 Adding global effects
=========================

It is possible to define your own global effects and have them activated
automatically when ‘writeroom-mode’ is activated.  For example, you may
want to add your own font or colour effects, or replace the default
fullscreen function with one that works in an older Emacs version.  To
do this, you should write a function that takes one argument and that
activates the effect if the argument is ‘1’ and disables it if the
argument is ‘-1’.  Then add this function to the user option
‘writeroom-global-effects’ by checking the box "Custom effects",
clicking the [INS] button and adding the function to the list.

To give an example, if you want to activate a minimalist colour theme in
‘writeroom-mode’, you can write the following function:

(defun my-writeroom-theme (arg)
  (cond
   ((= arg 1)
    (enable-theme 'minimalist-dark))
   ((= arg -1)
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    (disable-theme 'minimalist-dark))))
=======
    (enable-theme 'minimalist-dark))))
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Note that the argument that global effect functions should accept is
compatible with the arguments that minor mode functions take when called
from Lisp: a positive number (among other possibilities) activates and a
negative number deactivates.  This makes it possible to add a global
minor mode function to ‘writeroom-global-effects’ and have it do the
right thing.
