****************

`writeroom-mode' is a minor mode for Emacs that implements a
distraction-free writing mode similar to the famous Writeroom editor
for OS X. `writeroom-mode' is meant for GNU Emacs 24.

Install `writeroom-mode.el' in the usual way (it is on Melpa
(http://melpa.milkbox.net/)) and activate it in a buffer by calling
`M-x writeroom-mode RET'. By default, `writeroom-mode' does the
following things:

   * activate fullscreen

   * disable transparency

   * disable the menu bar

   * disable the tool bar

   * disable the scroll bar

   * disable the fringes

   * disable the mode line

   * add window margins to the current buffer so that the text is 80
     characters wide.

The last three effects are buffer-local. The other effects apply to the
current frame. Because `writeroom-mode' is a minor mode, this isn't
entirely on the up and up, since minor modes aren't supposed to have
such global effects. But `writeroom-mode' is meant for distraction-free
writing, so these effects do make sense.

All effects listed above can be switched off separately in the
customization group `writeroom'. Fullscreen, transparency, scroll bar,
menu bar and tool bar can be switched off by unchecking them in the
option `writeroom-global-functions', the other effects have a
corresponding toggle. Normally, the option fullscreen disables the
window decorations and make the Emacs frame occupy the entire screen.
If you prefer to "just" maximise the frame (i.e., keep the window
decorations and do not cover the window manager's panel), you can set
the option `writeroom-fullscreen-effect' to `maximized'. The width of
the text area is controlled by the option `writeroom-width'. It can be
an absolute value, in which case it indicates the number of columns, or
it can be a relative value. In that case, it should be a number between
0 and 1.

It is possible to activate `writeroom-mode' in more than one buffer.
The global effects are of course activated only once and they remain
active until `writeroom-mode' is deactivated in _all_ buffers.

Apart from the buffer-local minor mode, there is also a global minor
mode, appropriately called `global-writeroom-mode'. This function can
be called to activate `writeroom-mode' in _all_ buffers with specific
major modes, as defined by the user option `writeroom-major-modes'.
When `global-writeroom-mode' is active, the function `writeroom-mode'
can still be called to enable or disable `writeroom-mode' in individual
buffers. Calling `global-writeroom-mode' again disables
`writeroom-mode' in all buffers in which it is active, even those in
which it was activated manually.
